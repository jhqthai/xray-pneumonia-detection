This objective of this project is to classify pneumonia in chest x-ray. 

Four different neural network architectures are used for their feature learning layers. The classification layers are then modified and tested for each of the model with most works focused on the VGG16 network.

The models initial build from the guidance from community and resources such as Tensorflow Community, Google Colab Community, Medium and other resources. Specific projects which are closely related to this project can be found below.
